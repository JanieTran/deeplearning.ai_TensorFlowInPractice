## Takeaway Notes

**Why dropout works?**
- Neighbouring neurons often have similar weights
- A neuron can over-weigh the input from a previous layer's neuron, and can over specialize as a result

**Tensorflow Datasets**

It was a pain dealing with `tensorflow-datasets` and I couldn't install it without breaking my environment, either pip or conda, so had to skip all exercises involving it.
